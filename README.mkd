Package contents description
-----------------------------

There is a set of patches over Apache 2 component `suexec`.
It's distrbuted under same license, stated in `debian/copyright` file.

The "master" branch contains all the features available.

Branches described below should be considered as tags (development stages):

### loosen

less security checks.

Options:

- `AP_SUEXEC_SKIP_DOC_ROOT_CHECK`: scripts which are executed on behalf of vhost owner may reside in arbitrary directory
- `AP_SUEXEC_EXEC_ROOT`: allow execute of root-owned scripts on behalf of vhost owner


### rlimit

new features to limit the number of processes, memory and cputime

Options:

- `AP_SUEXEC_RLIMIT_MEMORY_META` Memory (in bytes), e.g. 268435456
- `AP_SUEXEC_RLIMIT_NPROC_SOFT` Number of processes, e.g. 53
- `AP_SUEXEC_RLIMIT_CPU_SOFT` CPU Time, e.g. 330


### cgroups

new features to execute processes in cgroup context unsing cgrulesengd or hardcoded values

Options:

- `AP_SUEXEC_CGROUPS_FAST` (hardcoded)
- `AP_SUEXEC_CGROUPS` (cgrulesengd)
- `AP_SUEXEC_CGROUPS_FAST_PATH` (must be specified in `suexec.h`)
- `AP_SUEXEC_CGROUPS_FAST_CONTROLLERS` (must be specified in `suexec.h`)


### sticky CPU affinity

Options:

- `AP_STICKY_AFFINITY`: process *sticks* to the CPU core it was started on. This should take off some stress from process scheduler constantly trying to re-schedule hundreds of processes between cores.

The exact set of features which should be compiled in the executable is tuned in the Makefile. Hardcoded values for cgroups are set in `suexec.h`.

It makes sense to build suexec as debian package, otherwise (if you want to compile things manually) the list of dependencies can be found in `debian/control` file.

Happy restricting!
